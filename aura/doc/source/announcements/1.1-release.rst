Aura 1.1 Release
================

For you, Arch users, the fruits of my winter holiday: Aura 1.1

Aura is a package manager for Arch Linux with full support for
installing and upgrading AUR packages. With version 1.1 it has many new
features to make managing your system easier.

New with Version 1.1
--------------------

-  ``--save`` option. Stores a record of all installed packages.
-  ``--restore`` option. Restores a state stored with ``--save``. Good
   for reversing system breakage.
-  ``-k`` suboption of ``-A``. Shows PKGBUILD diffs when installing /
   upgrading.
-  ``--aurignore`` option. Ignores given AUR packages when installing /
   upgrading.
-  Bash and zsh completions now available.
-  Aura now reads pacman-color's /etc/pacman.d/color.conf if available.
   This affects the colours in ``-Ai`` and ``-As``.
-  Aura now stores the most recent PKGBUILD when installing a package.
   This is so ``-Ak`` has something to diff with when upgrading next.
-  Much cleaner code.

On the Horizon
--------------

-  Fish completions.
-  Reworked PKGBUILD parser.
-  Haskell binding to libalpm.

A big thanks to all of Aura's users! I couldn't have got this far
without your support.
