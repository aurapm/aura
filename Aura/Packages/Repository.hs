{- Get only those packages that are not already installed
  This is, sadly, a bit of a hack. The reason we do this is that
  otherwise ABS installs using --absdeps tend to fail when they reach
  a split/virtual package and cannot sync it. By filtering already
  installed packages the user can circumvemt this problem.
