.SH NAME
aura \- A package manager for Arch Linux and the AUR.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIaura\fR <operation> [options] [package(s)]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fIaura\fR is a multi-lingual package manager for Arch Linux written in 
Haskell.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the Arch User
Repositories (AUR), allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
It allows \fIall\fR pacman operations and provides \fInew\fR custom ones
for dealing with AUR packages. This differs from some other AUR package
managers.
 
.SH OPERATIONS
.P
\fB\-A\fR, \-\-aursync [package(s)]
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the [A]UR. Default action installs packages
from the AUR. During building, makepkg output is \fInot\fR shown 
by default. After building, the built \fI.pkg.tar.xz\fR file is moved
to the package cache and installed from there. This allows for easy 
AUR package downgrading.
.RE 
.P
\fB\-C\fR, \-\-downgrade [package(s)]
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the package [C]ache. Default action downgrades
specified packages. This process is interactive, allowing the user to choose
from any previous version they have available in the package cache.
.RE
.P
\fB\-L\fR, \-\-viewlog
.RS 4
Perform actions involving the pacman [L]ogfile.
Default action opens the log for read-only viewing.
.RE
.P
\fB\-O\fR, \-\-orphans [package(s)]
.RS 4
Perform actions involving [O]rphan packages. Orphan packages are packages
installed as dependencies, but are no longer required by any other package.
\fI\-O\fR's default action can do one of two things. 
If no extra argument is given, the current orphan packages installed
are displayed. If a package name is given, it is `adopted`.
This changes the package's install reason to `As Explicit`.
This is a shortcut for `-D --asexplicit`.
.RE

.SH AUR SYNC OPTIONS (\fI\-A\fR)
.P
\fB\-a\fR, \-\-delmakedeps
.RS 4
Uninstalls build dependencies that are no longer required after installing
the main package. This prevents the creation of orphan packages. Also note
that while the package itself will be uninstalled, its package file will
remain in the cache.
.RE
.P
\fB\-d\fR, \-\-deps <package(s)>
.RS 4
View all the dependencies of a package. This process is recursive for
AUR packages, so all dependencies of dependencies (and so on) will also
be shown. This can aid the pre-install package research process.
.RE
.P
\fB\-p\fR, \-\-pkgbuild <package(s)>
.RS 4
Outputs an AUR package's PKGBUILD. Use this before installing new packages
to confirm that the build scripts aren't doing anything fishy.
.RE
.P
\fB\-u\fR, \-\-sysupgrade
.RS 4
Upgrade all installed AUR packages. \fI\-Au\fR is \fI\-Su\fR for AUR
packages.
.RE
.P
\fB\-w\fR, \-\-downloadonly <package(s)>
.RS 4
Download the source tarball. This doesn't contain source code, but instead
the PKGBUILD and .install file for the requested package. Running
\fImakepkg\fR in a directory with these files in it would build the package
manually.
.RE
.P
\fB\-x\fR, \-\-unsuppress
.RS 4
Unsuppress \fImakepkg\fR output during building. By default this output
is suppressed for a more silent install. Note that when this option
isn't used, \fImakepkg\fR output is actually collected and printed
if any errors occur.
.RE
.P
\-\-hotedit
.RS 4
Prompt the user immediately before a package is built to ask if they
wish to view/edit the PKGBUILD.
This is not default behavior and thus does not have a single\-letter option.
Research into packages (and by extension, their PKGBUILDs) should be done
before any building occurs. Please use \fI\-Ap\fR and \fI\-Ad\fR for this,
as they will be much faster at presenting information than searching the
AUR website manually.
.RE

.SH DOWNGRADE OPTIONS (\fI\-C\fR)
.P
\fB\-b\fR, \-\-backup <path>
.RS 4
Backup the package cache to a given directory. The given directory must
already exist. During copying, progress will be shown. If the copy takes too 
long, you may want to reduce the number of older versions of each package by
using \fI\-Cc\fR.
.RE
.P
\fB\-c\fR, \-\-clean <versions-to-retain>
.RS 4
This saves a given number of package versions for each package and deletes
the rest from the package cache. Count is made from the most recent version, 
so using:
.RS 4
aura -Cc 3
.RE
would save the three most recent versions of each package file.
Giving the number 0 as an argument is identical to \fI\-Scc\fR.
.RE
.P
\fB\-s\fR, \-\-search <regex>
.RS 4
Search the package cache via a regex. Any package name that matches the regex
will be output as\-is.
.RE

.SH LOGFILE OPTIONS (\fI\-L\fR)
.P
\fB\-i\fR, \-\-info <package(s)>
.RS 4
Displays install / upgrade history for a given package. Under the `Recent
Actions` section, only the last five entries will be displayed. If there are
less than five actions ever performed with the package, what is available will
be printed.
.RE
.P
\fB\-s\fR, \-\-search <regex>
.RS 4
Search the pacman log file via a regex. Useful for singling out any and all
actions performed on a package.
.RE

.SH ORPHAN PACKAGE OPTIONS (\fI\-O\fR)
.P
\fB\-j\fR, \-\-abandon
.RS 4
Uninstall all orphan packages. 
.RE

.SH PACMAN / AURA DUAL FUNCTIONALITY OPTIONS
.P
\-\-noconfirm
.RS 4
Never ask for any Aura or Pacman confirmation. Any time a prompt would appear,
say before building or installation, it is assumed the user answered in
whatever way would progress the program.
.RE

.SH MISC. OPTIONS
.P
These options do not require a superordinate flag, such as \fI\-A\fR.
.P
\-\-conf
.RS 4
View the pacman configuration file in read-only mode.
.RE
.P
\-\-languages
.RS 4
Display the available output languages.
.RE

.SH LANGUAGE OPTIONS
.P
Aura is available in multiple languages. As options, they can be used
with either their English names or their real names written in their
native characters. The available languages are, in option form:
.P
\-\-english (default)
.P
\-\-japanese, \-\-日本語
.P
\-\-polish, \-\-polski
\-\-croatian, \-\-hrvatski

.SH SEE ALSO
.P
\fBpacman\fR(8), \fBpacman.conf\fR(5), \fBmakepkg\fR(8)

.SH BUGS
.P
It is not recommended to install non-ABS, non-AUR packages with pacman or
aura. Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a `-Au` and attempt
to upgrade them. If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is
a legitimate AUR package with the same name as the one you installed)
previous installations could be overwritten.
